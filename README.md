# Leetcode Solutions
>A collection of C++17 solutions to random Leetcode.com problems

## Overview
This repo is a running collection of solutions to problems I have solved on 
[Leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/). All solutions are written in C++
and have been tested with the C++17 GNU C++ Compiler. 

## Usage
All solutions given are self contained in one file each, and can be run using your
favourite C++ compiler. *Almost* every solution given has a demonstration program
that you can run yourself. For example:

````
git clone https://github.com/joelrorseth/Leetcode-Solutions
cd Leetcode-Solutions
g++ -std=c++17 valid_anagram.cxx
````

You can then run the program using ```./a.out``` on MacOS or ```./a.exe``` on Windows.
